# Drowsiness_system
Drowsiness detection system for vehicles.

  Driver drowsiness a major cause of frequently occurring roadside collisions worldwide, can stem from medical problems, non-stop traveling on long trips, and the increased comfort level in modern vehicles.  Drowsiness detection systems (DDS) can help avoid such incidents by notifying the drivers in time to stop travel. To address this problem we propose a project employing Python, OpenCV, and Keras to develop a drowsiness detection system. By harnessing computer vision techniques and deep learning models, we can effectively monitor the driver's condition and intervene as needed. By comparing real-time EAR with baseline values, the system accurately predicts drowsiness. Moreover, it incorporates a smart alarm system.
